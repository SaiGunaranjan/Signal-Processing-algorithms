# Signal Processing Algorithms
In this repository, I will be developing various signal processing algorithms and signal models. More specifically, I will be working on RADAR signal processing and RADAR modelling techniques. I will attempt to solve some of the most common problems in FMCW RADAR.
1. High Resolution Spectral Estimation techniques
2. Variable thresholding algorithms like CFAR (1D, 2D)
3. Range bin migration
4. Doppler Extension
5. RADAR base band point source modelling
6. Doppler Division multiplexing

Some of the other signal processing algorithms I have worked on in this repository include
1. Modelling of Minimum phase systems
2. Signal reconstruction under minimum phase constraints
3. Filter interpretation of Vandermonde Least Squares
4. Compressive sensing
