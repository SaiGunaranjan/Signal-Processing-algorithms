# Spectral-Estimation-algorithms
This repository/project will contain the python scripts of various signal processing algorithms implemented by me.

Below is a popular naming convention used for variable names, constants, classes, class methods, etc.
1. Constants are defined by ALL_CAPITALS
2. Classes are defined by ClassNames (starting word of each sub word should be camel case)
3. Class methods are defined by methodName (starting word is small case and other sub-words start with Camel case)
